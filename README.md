# India-Academia-Connect-AI-Hackathon
Problem Statement:
During the event, participants will be working on a problem of Image classification. The input dataset will consist of images containing Hindi characters. The challenge is to identify the presence of a character in images using Convolutional Neural Networks

The dataset will contain the following:

Train Dataset: Consists of sample reference sets which can be used by participants to train the Convolution Neural Network. The participants are recommended to use their own training dataset if required. 
Test Dataset: The test dataset will contain the images to be classified and results to be submitted in the form of a JSON file.

- train folder
You can find the NON TEXT images (-ve class) in the ‘background’ sub folder.
TEXT images (+ve class) are stored in ‘hi’ sub folders.

- test folder
This folder contains images to be classified. Label with 0 for NON TEXT images.
