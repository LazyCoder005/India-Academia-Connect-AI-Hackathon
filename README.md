# India-Academia-Connect-AI-Hackathon
Problem Statement During the event, participants will be working on a problem of Image classification. The input dataset will consist of images containing Hindi characters. The challenge is to identify the presence of a character in images using Convolutional Neural Networks.  The dataset will contain the following:  Train Dataset: Consists of sample reference sets which can be used by participants to train the Convolution Neural Network. The participants are recommended to use their own training dataset if required.  Test Dataset: The test dataset will contain the images to be classified and results to be submitted in the form of a JSON file. More details on the JSON format and a sample provided as part of the dataset. Submissions are evaluated on Accuracy Score between the predicted and the actual labels on the test dataset.  You can download the dataset from this Drive Link. The dataset consists of a README file. Fill out and submit the official application form by Sept 12, 2021. The application calls for teams to provide test results for problem statements. Please ensure your solution is submitted as JSON, template provided.
